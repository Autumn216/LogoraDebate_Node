This hook is returning three boolean variables to enable responsive design :
- _isMobile_ : screen width under 576 pixels
- _isTablet_ : screen width betwwen 577 and 768 pixels
- _isDesktop_ : screen width above 769 pixels

It is using [react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive) under the hood.

### Component usage
```js
import { useResponsive } from '@logora/debate.hooks.use_responsive';
```
```js
const ResponsiveComponent = () => {
	const [isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop] = useResponsive();

	return (
        <>
            { isMobile && <div>Displayed on mobile screens only</div> }
        </>
    )
}
```
